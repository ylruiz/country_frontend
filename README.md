## About the Project

This repository contains two implementations of the same application.

- **Expo (React Native):** A JavaScript-based framework for building cross-platform apps.
- **Flutter:** A Dart-based framework for building natively compiled applications.

The purpose of this project is to compare and contrast the development experience, performance, and code structure of both frameworks.

## Features

- **Feature 1:** Display a list of countries
- **Feature 2:** Display the contries details on selection.

## Technologies Used

### Expo (React Native)

- **React Native:** Framework for building cross-platform apps.
- **Expo:** Toolchain for React Native development.
- **TypeScript:** Programming languages.
- **Expo router:** Routing and navigation.

### Flutter

- **Flutter:** Framework for building natively compiled apps.
- **Dart:** Programming language.
- **Flutter Navigation:** Routing and navigation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the apps, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (for Expo)
- **Expo CLI** (for Expo)
- **Flutter SDK** (for Flutter)
- **Android Studio/Xcode** (for emulators/simulators)
- **Git** (for version control)

### Installation

Clone the repository:

**https**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ylruiz/country_frontend.git
cd country_frontend
```

**ssh**

```bash
git clone git@github.com:ylruiz/country_frontend.git
cd country_frontend
```

#### Install dependencies for the Expo app:

**npm**

```bash
cd country_expo_demo
npm install
```

**yarn**

```bash
cd country_expo_demo
yarn
```

#### Install dependencies for the Flutter app:

```bash
cd country_flutter_demo
flutter pub get
```

## Running the Apps

### Expo (React Native)

Navigate to the Expo app directory:

```bash
cd country_expo_demo
```

Start the development server:

**npm**

```bash
npm start
```

**yarn**

```bash
yarn start
```

Scan the QR code with the Expo Go app on your mobile device, or run it on an emulator/simulator.

You can also select web to run the application.

### Flutter

Navigate to the Flutter app directory:

```bash
cd country_flutter_demo
```

Run the app:

```bash
flutter run
```

You will be able to select chrome, an emulator, simulator or connected device to run the application.
